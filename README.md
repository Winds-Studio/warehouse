# Pyro Warehouse üè≠

Pyro Warehouse is a flexible and extensible game server software distribution system that provides a unified API for downloading server binaries from various games and loaders. Currently, it only supports Minecraft server distributions. However, its architecture is completely game-agnostic and designed to accommodate any game server software.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pyrohost/warehouse.git

# Change to the project directory
cd warehouse

# Build the Rust project
cargo build --release # --release is optional but recommended

# Run the server
./target/release/warehouse # or `cargo run --release`
```

For detailed API documentation, please visit the `/docs/` endpoint when running the server. (e.g. `http://localhost:8080/docs/`)

## Configuration

Pyro Warehouse is configured using environment variables. The following variables are available:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `WAREHOUSE_BIND_ADDRESS` | The address to bind the server to | `127.0.0.1:8080` |
| `WAREHOUSE_STORAGE_PATH` | The path to cache server binaries | `./storage` |
| `WAREHOUSE_LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level (error, warn, info, debug, trace) | `info` |
| `WAREHOUSE_CACHE_TTL` | Cache time-to-live in seconds | `3600` |

These variables can also be set in a `.env` file in the runtime directory.
